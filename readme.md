# BachelorTree

### Introduction

BachelorTree is a silly project.  My girlfriend really seems to like watching ABC's show, "The Bachelor".  Hence, I sometimes watch it since I enjoy her company.  The show itself is a fairly silly, but I'm always curious as to whether or not there's any way to answer a few questions:
  - Why do some girls stay?
  - Why do some girls go?
  - Who will go next?  *(Boo!  Hiss!!  Predictive analysis!!!)*

### More explanation

### Concept

1. We write some sort of data scraper.
2. We use decision trees* to analyze the data we've captured
3. We watch the show next week and realize how wrong we are.

### So Far
I've written a data scraper that hits the ABC website and pulls some data down.  I've jammed all that into a JSON file that has today's date on it in /feature_data/.  

### How you can help
 - You can give me realistic advice on better methods.
 - You can add or enhance the data about the contestants.
 - You can write some code to do something you think is necessary.

*Yes, I know, decision trees on a dataset of 24 points with many features is a horrible, horrible idea.
